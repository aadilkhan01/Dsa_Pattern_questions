2. **Progress to Medium and Hard** problems as you become comfortable
3. **Update your status** as you complete each problem (replace ⬜ with ✅)
4. **Focus on understanding the pattern** rather than memorizing solutions
5. **Practice similar problems** to reinforce the pattern

## Study Tips

- Spend 15-20 minutes thinking about a problem before looking at the solution
- Implement the solution from scratch after understanding the approach  
- Try to solve variations of the same pattern
- Review and practice patterns you find challenging
- Time yourself on medium problems (aim for 20-30 minutes)
- For hard problems, focus on understanding rather than speed initially
